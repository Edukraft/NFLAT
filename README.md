Money Matters: Smart Goals and Financial Analysis

Understand the concept of Money
Money is whatever can be used in order to settle payments. Nowadays, the most common kind of money are current accounts in the banks.

Money as medium of exchange and as medium of storage
Money plays three main roles:
1. it is the medium of exchange that settle payments. People accept money in exchange of goods and services. Nothing is owed anymore. 
2. money is the most common medium of account, i.e. it is the good some quantity of which serves as unit of account for prices. Prices are expressed using monetary expressions.
3. money is a store of value over time and across people, firms, countries. Selling things gives money that can be saved and spent in the future for many different goods and services. However, there exist other financial instruments - and even goods - that can serve as a store of value as well.

Understand the concept of Net-worth

For a company, total assets minus total liabilities. Net worth is an important determinant of the value of a company, considering it is composed primarily of all the money that has been invested since its inception, as well as the retained earnings for the duration of its operation. Net worth can be used to determine creditworthiness because it gives a snapshot of the company's investment history. Also called owner's equity, shareholders' equity, or net assets.

Know the difference between money and wealth
Money is an intangible concept, which means it cannot be touched, it cannot be smelled; however it can be seen in terms of numbers. Money does have a few properties such as it must be a medium of exchange; a unit of account; a store of value; and, occasionally in the past, a standard of deferred payment. Wealth can be divided between two different meanings. One meaning states a person that has a lot of possessions and money can be considered as wealthy. While, another definition suggests that a person that has enough possessions that would allow him to sustain himself for the next coming days is considered as wealthier.

Difference between Assets and Liabilities

An asset is anything, which you own and which is valuable, whether it is tangible or intangible. Assets are said to have positive economic value. Simply put an asset is something that is worth money and which a person can exchange for money.

Examples of tangible assets, that is assets we can see and touch, are cash, goods or inventory, land, buildings and equipment. Examples of intangible assets, that is, assets which we cannot see or touch, are trademarks, copyright, patents, goodwill and stock.

A liability on the other hand is an obligation – for example money that must be paid or services that must be performed. A liability is the result of a past transaction or event. Settlement of a liability usually involves the handing over of an asset. Examples of liabilities include salaries payable, accounts payable, as well as long or short-term loans which individuals or companies take and which they, of course, have to pay back.

To put it simply, an asset is something that you OWN while a liability is something that you OWE.
A financially successful person or company has more assets than liabilities. This means that they have the means to fulfill or settle their obligations. On the other hand, a person or company whose liabilities are more than their assets is probably in trouble.

Understand the relation between assets and income; liabilities and expenses; and calculation of net worth

Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity or Assets - Liabilities = Shareholders' or Owners' Equity
Owners equity = Contributed Capital + Retained Earnings
Assets – Liabilities = Contributed Capital + Retained Earnings
Retained Earnings = Net Income – Dividends
Assets – Liabilities – Contributed Capital = Net Income – Dividends
Assets – Liabilities – Contributed Capital + Dividends = Net Income 
And Net Income = Income – Expenses

Understand importance of financial goals in personal financial planning (S.M.A.R.T. goals)

SMART goal setting brings structure and trackability into your goals and objectives. In stead of vague resolutions, SMART goal setting creates verifiable trajectories towards a certain objective, with clear milestones and an estimation of the goal's attainability. Every goal or objective, from intermediary step to overarching objective, can be made S.M.A.R.T. and as such, brought closer to reality.

In corporate life, SMART goal setting is one of the most effective and yet least used tools for achieving goals. Once you've charted to outlines of your project, it's time to set specifice intermediary goals. With the SMART checklist, you can evaluate your objectives. SMART goal setting also creates transparency throughout the company. It clarifies the way goals came into existence, and the criteria their realisation will conform to. To make your goal S.M.A.R.T., it needs to conform to the following criteria: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Timely.

Understand the meaning of each term in S.M.A.R.T. goals: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic and Time bound

S.M.A.R.T. goal setting: Specific

What exactly do you want to achieve? The more specific your description, the bigger the chance you'll get exactly that. S.M.A.R.T. goal setting clarifies the difference between 'I want to be a millionaire' and 'I want to make €50.000 a month for the next ten years by creating a new software product'.

Questions you may ask yourself when setting your goals and objectives are:

What exactly do I want to achieve?
Where?
How?
When?
With whom?
What are the conditions and limitations?
Why exactly do I want to reach this goal? What are possible alternative ways of achieving the same?
S.M.A.R.T. goal setting: Measurable

Measurable goals means that you identify exactly what it is you will see, hear and feel when you reach your goal. It means breaking your goal down into measurable elements. You'll need concrete evidence. Being happier is not evidence; not smoking anymore because you adhere to a healthy lifestyle where you eat vegetables twice a day and fat only once a week, is.

Measurable goals can go a long way in refining what exactly it is that you want, too. Defining the physical manifestations of your goal or objective makes it clearer, and easier to reach.

S.M.A.R.T. goal setting: Attainable

Is your goal attainable? That means investigating whether the goal really is acceptable to you. You weigh the effort, time and other costs your goal will take against the profits and the other obligations and priorities you have in life.

If you don't have the time, money or talent to reach a certain goal you'll certainly fail and be miserable. That doesn't mean that you can't take something that seems impossible and make it happen by planning smartly and going for it!

There's nothing wrong with shooting for the stars; if you aim to make your department twice as efficient this year as it was last year with no extra labour involved, how bad is it when you only reach 1,8 times? Not too bad...

S.M.A.R.T. goal setting: Relevant

Is reaching your goal relevant to you? Do you actually want to run a multinational, be famous, have three children and a busy job? You decide for yourself whether you have the personality for it, or your team has the bandwidth.

If you're lacking certain skills, you can plan trainings. If you lack certain resources, you can look for ways of getting them.

The main questions, why do you want to reach this goal? What is the objective behind the goal, and will this goal really achieve that?

You could think that having a bigger team will make it perform better, but will it really?

S.M.A.R.T. goal setting: Timely

Time is money! Make a tentative plan of everything you do. Everybody knows that deadlines are what makes most people switch to action. So install deadlines, for yourself and your team, and go after them. Keep the timeline realistic and flexible, that way you can keep morale high. Being too stringent on the timely aspect of your goal setting can have the perverse effect of making the learning path of achieving your goals and objectives into a hellish race against time – which is most likely not how you want to achieve anything.
